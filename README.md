# Projects

The following is a compilation of small projects to demonstrate various skills:

Machine Learning in Python - Various machine learning projects 
* CNN.ipynb: Implemented a convolutional nueral network as well as a fully connected nueral network and compared the results with different parameters
* Fashion.ipynb: 
* spam_detection1.ipynb: Used a descision tree classifier to detect spam emails from a large dataset achieving an accuracy of about 93%
* spam_detection2.ipynb: Used a random forest classifier to detect spam emails from a large dataset achieving an accuracy of about 97% and comparing the effects of different initializtion settings
* spam_detection3.ipynb: Used a support vector machine to detect spam emails from a large dataset achieving a best accuracy of about 99%. I also analyzed the effects of various kernel functions and regularization parameters.
* stroke_and_diabetes_ads_analysis: Conducted an analysis of an automated decision system designed to predict whether or not a person has had a stroke based on a multitude of factors relating to lifestyle choices and overall health.  

Sports Betting Analysis in Hadoop - An analysis of historical sports betting data
* Using tools like Hive, Spark and MapReduce, I analyzed a historical MLB dataset containing information about games from the previous few seasons.
* I found some trends and information that may be useful to sports bettors.   

Climate Change - A collection of machine learning models centered around climate change 
* ML for Climate Change.ipynb: Analysis of Climate Change from various anlges. 
* Identifying Crops.ipynb: Implemented a Logistic Regression model to identify crops on a given area of land using data collected from Sentinel-2 (a satelite that can be used to map changes in land cover and to monitor the world's forests) containing 13 spectral bands.
* Dengue_Fever_Prediction.ipynb: Used various machine learning methods (Poisson GlM, Linear Regression, Artificial Nueral Network) to predict the number of cases of Dengue Fever in a given time interval.
* Predicting building energy use.ipynb: Implemented a Linear Regression model to predict how much energy is used by a building.
* GAN_Methane_Plumes.ipynb: Created and developed a GAN to generate simulated data to replicate Methane plumes because of a lack of data. Then implemented a Convolutional nueral network to test the accuracy of the classifier, given the more abundant data.
