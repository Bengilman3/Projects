# Projects

The following is a compilation of small projects to demonstrate various skills:

Machine Learning in Python - Various machine learning projects 
* CNN.ipynb: Implemented a convolutional nueral network as well as a fully connected nueral network and compared the results with different parameters
* Fashion.ipynb: 
* spam_detection1.ipynb: Used a descision tree classifier to detect spam emails from a large dataset achieving an accuracy of about 93%
* spam_detection2.ipynb: Used a random forest classifier to detect spam emails from a large dataset achieving an accuracy of about 97% and comparing the effects of different initializtion settings
* spam_detection3.ipynb: Used a support vector machine to detect spam emails from a large dataset achieving a best accuracy of about 99%. I also analyzed the effects of various kernel functions and regularization parameters.   

Sports Betting Analysis in Hadoop - An analysis of historical sports betting data
* Using tools like Hive, Spark and MapReduce, I analyzed a historical MLB dataset containing information about games from the previous few seasons.
* I found some trends and information that may be useful to sports bettors.   

Climate Change - A collection of machine learning models centered around climate change 
* ML for Climate Change.ipynb: Analysis of Climate Change from various anlges.
* Identifying Crops: Implemented a Logistic Regression to identify crops on a given area of land using data collected from Sentinel-2 (a satelite that can be used to map changes in land cover and to monitor the world's forests) containing 13 spectral bands.
* Dengue_Fever_Prediction: Used various machine learning methods (Poisson GlM, Linear Regression, Artificial Nueral Network) to predict the number of cases of Dengue Fever in a given time interval.
