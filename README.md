# Projects

The following is a compilation of small projects to demonstrate various skills:

Machine Learning in Python
* CNN.ipynb: Implemented a convolutional nueral network as well as a fully connected nueral network and compared the results with different parameters
* Fashion.ipynb: 
* spam_detection1: Used a descision tree classifier to detect spam emails from a large dataset achieving an accuracy of about 93%
* spam_detection1: Used a random forest classifier to detect spam emails from a large dataset achieving an accuracy of about 97% and comparing the effects of different initializtion settings 
* spam_detection1: Used a support vector machine to detect spam emails from a large dataset achieving a best accuracy of about 99%. I also analyzed the effects of various kernel functions and regularization parameters.
